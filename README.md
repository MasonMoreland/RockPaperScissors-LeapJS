# RockPaperScissors
Sample project using a LeapJS motion sensor to interact with a WebUI using a 3D hand rendering to play Rock Paper Scissors.

This project is a small demo and not maintained.

A notable feature is a small modification to the LeapJS library to modify the rendering canvas window size (which was tricky since their library did not support this in any way).
